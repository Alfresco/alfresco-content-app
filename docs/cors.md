# Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

## Chrome Workaround

For the Chrome browser, you can use the following plugin that allows you to toggle CORS:
[Allow-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)

## Firefox Workaround

Firefox users can try the following plugin: [CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Gb/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/)

## Safari Workaround

If you are developing or testing with Safari then you can use the "Develop" menu to toggle the CORS mode.
Please note that the page must be reloaded every time you change CORS settings.
