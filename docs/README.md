# Alfresco Example Content Application

## Introduction

The Alfresco Content Application is an example application built using
[Alfresco Application Development Framework (ADF)](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components) components.

### Who is this example application for

This example application demonstrates to Angular software engineers
how to construct a content application using the Alfresco ADF.

This example application represents a meaningful composition of ADF components that provide end users
with a simple and easy to use interface for working with files stored in the Alfresco Content Services repository.

### Prerequisites

This application uses the latest releases from Alfresco:

- [Alfresco ADF (2.4.0)](https://community.alfresco.com/community/application-development-framework/pages/get-started)
- [Alfresco Content Services (5.2.3)](https://www.alfresco.com/platform/content-services-ecm)
  or [Alfresco Community Edition (201802 EA)](https://www.alfresco.com/products/community/download)

<p class="warning">
You also need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">node.js</a> (LTS) installed to build it locally from source code.
</p>

The latest version of the Alfresco Content platform is required
due to the application using the latest [REST APIs](https://docs.alfresco.com/5.2/pra/1/topics/pra-welcome.html) developments.
