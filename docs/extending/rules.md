# Rules

Rules allow evaluating conditions for extension components.
For example, you can disable or hide elements based on certain rules.

Every rule is backed by a condition evaluator.

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../../extension.schema.json",
  "$version": "1.0.0",
  "$name": "plugin1",

  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "app.trashcan",
      "type": "app.navigation.isTrashcan"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules can accept other rules as parameters:

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../../extension.schema.json",
  "$version": "1.0.0",
  "$name": "plugin1",

  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "app.toolbar.favorite.canAdd",
      "type": "core.every",
      "parameters": [
        { "type": "rule", "value": "app.selection.canAddFavorite" },
        { "type": "rule", "value": "app.navigation.isNotRecentFiles" },
        { "type": "rule", "value": "app.navigation.isNotSharedFiles" },
        { "type": "rule", "value": "app.navigation.isNotSearchResults" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<p class="tip">
You can also negate any rule by utilizing a `!` prefix:
`!app.navigation.isTrashcan` is the opposite of the `app.navigation.isTrashcan`.
</p>

It is also possible to use inline references to registered evaluators without declaring rules,
in case you do not need providing extra parameters, or chaining multiple rules together.

## Core Evaluators

You can create new rules by chaining other rules and evaluators.

| Key        | Description                                                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| core.every | Evaluates to `true` if all chained rules evaluate to `true`.                  |
| core.some  | Evaluates to `true` if at least one of the chained rules evaluates to `true`. |
| core.not   | Evaluates to `true` if all chained rules evaluate to `false`.                 |

Below is an example of the composite rule definition that combines the following conditions:

- user has selected a single file
- user is not using the **Trashcan** page

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../../extension.schema.json",
  "$version": "1.0.0",
  "$name": "plugin1",

  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "app.toolbar.canViewFile",
      "type": "core.every",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "type": "rule",
          "value": "app.selection.file"
        },
        {
          "type": "rule",
          "value": "core.not",
          "parameters": [
            {
              "type": "rule",
              "value": "app.navigation.isTrashcan"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can now declare a toolbar button action that is based on the rule above.

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../../extension.schema.json",
  "$version": "1.0.0",
  "$name": "plugin1",

  "features": {
    "toolbar": [
      {
        "id": "app.toolbar.preview",
        "type": "button",
        "title": "View File",
        "icon": "open_in_browser",
        "actions": {
          "click": "VIEW_FILE"
        },
        "rules": {
          "visible": "app.toolbar.canViewFile"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The button will be visible only when the linked rule evaluates to `true`.

## Navigation Evaluators

The application exposes a set of navigation-related evaluators to help developers restrict or enable certain actions based on the route or page displayed.

The negated evaluators are provided just to simplify development, and to avoid having complex rule trees just to negate the rules,
for example mixing `core.every` and `core.not`.

<p class="tip">
You can also negate any rule by utilizing a `!` prefix:
`!app.navigation.isTrashcan` is the opposite of the `app.navigation.isTrashcan`.
</p>

| Key                               | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| app.navigation.folder.canCreate   | User can create content in the currently opened folder. |
| app.navigation.folder.canUpload   | User can upload content to the currently opened folder. |
| app.navigation.isTrashcan         | User is using the **Trashcan** page.                    |
| app.navigation.isNotTrashcan      | Current page is not a **Trashcan**.                     |

| app.navigation.isSharedFiles      | User is using the **Shared Files** page.                |
| app.navigation.isNotSharedFiles   | Current page is not **Shared Files**.                   |
| app.navigation.isFavorites        | User is using the **Favorites** page.                   |
| app.navigation.isNotFavorites     | Current page is not **Favorites**                       |

### Example

The rule in the example below evaluates to `true` if all the conditions are met:

- user has selected node(s)
- user is not using the **Trashcan** page
- user is not using a **Libraries** page (**My Libraries**, **Favorite Libraries** or **Libraries Search Results** pages)

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../../extension.schema.json",
  "$version": "1.0.0",
  "$name": "plugin1",

  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "app.toolbar.canCopyNode",
      "type": "core.every",
      "parameters": [
        { "type": "rule", "value": "app.selection.notEmpty" },
        { "type": "rule", "value": "app.navigation.isNotTrashcan" },
        { "type": "rule", "value": "app.navigation.isNotLibraries" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
