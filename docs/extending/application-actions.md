# Application Actions

Application is using NgRx (Reactive libraries for Angular, inspired by Redux).
To get more information on NxRx please refer to the following resources:

- [Comprehensive Introduction to @ngrx/store](https://gist.github.com/btroncone/a6e4347326749f938510)

Most of the application features are already exposed in the form of NgRx Actions and corresponding Effects.
You can invoke any action via a single `Store` dispatcher, similar to the following:

```ts
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private store: Store<AppStore>) {}

  onClick() {
    this.store.dispatch(new SearchByTermAction('*'));
  }
}
```

The code above demonstrates a simple 'click' handler that invokes `Search by Term` feature
and automatically redirects user to the **Search Results** page.

Another example demonstrates viewing a node from a custom application service API:

```ts
export class MyService {
  constructor(private store: Store<AppStore>) {}

  viewFile(node: MinimalNodeEntity) {
    this.store.dispatch(new ViewFileAction(node));
  }
}
```

## Using with Extensions

You can invoke every application action from the extensions, i.e. buttons, menus, etc.

<p class="tip">
Many of the actions take currently selected nodes if no payload provided.
That simplifies declaring and invoking actions from the extension files.
</p>

In the example below, we create a new entry to the "NEW" menu dropdown
and provide a new `Create Folder (plugin1)` command that invokes the `CREATE_FOLDER` application action.

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../../extension.schema.json",
  "$version": "1.0.0",
  "$name": "plugin1",

  "features": {
    "create": [
      {
        "id": "plugin1.create.folder",
        "type": "default",
        "icon": "create_new_folder",
        "title": "Create Folder (plugin1)",
        "actions": {
          "click": "CREATE_FOLDER"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `CREATE_FOLDER` action will trigger corresponding NgRx Effects to show the dialog
and perform document list reload if needed.

Below is the list of public actions types you can use in the plugin definitions as a reference to the action:

| UNDO_DELETE_NODES | any[] | Reverts deletion of nodes (or selection). |
| RESTORE_DELETED_NODES  | MinimalNodeEntity[] | Restores deleted nodes (or selection). Typically used with Trashcan. |
