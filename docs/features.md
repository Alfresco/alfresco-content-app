## Introduction
The concept of this example is a simple user interface which makes accessing files in the Alfresco Content Services repository easy.

Often Content Management systems provide more capabilities out of the box than most users need;
providing too many capabilities to these users prevents them from working efficiently,
so they may end up using unsanctioned file management solutions which presents a proliferation of content storage
and collaboration solutions as well as compliance issues for organizations.

This application demonstrates how the complexity of Content Management can be simplified
using the Alfresco Application Development Framework to easily and quickly create custom solutions for specific user cases.

## User Interface - layout
There are three main areas of the application controlled by the [Layout component](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-content-app/tree/master/src/app/components/layout):
- [(1) Application Header](/header)
- [(2) Side Navigation](/side-nav)
- [(3) Document List](/doc-list)
