# Alfresco Content Application

## Requirements

| Name | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | 14.x |
| Npm | 6.x |

## Running

Create an `.env` file in the project root folder with the following content

```yml
APP_CONFIG_ECM_HOST="<URL>"
APP_CONFIG_PLUGIN_AOS=false
APP_CONFIG_PLUGIN_CONTENT_SERVICE=true
APP_CONFIG_PLUGIN_FOLDER_RULES=true
APP_CONFIG_ENABLE_MOBILE_APP_SWITCH=true
APP_CONFIG_SESSION_TIME_FOR_OPEN_APP_DIALOG_DISPLAY_IN_HOURS="12"
```

Where `<URL>` is the address of the ACS.

Run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm start content-ce
```

### Using Local ADF

Clone the `alfresco-ng2-components` and `alfresco-content-app` repositories in the same folder, and run the following command:

```sh
npm start content-ce -- --configuration=adf
```

Changing the ADF code results in the recompilation and hot-reloading of the ACA application.

## Triggering the build to use specific branch of ADF with CI flags

You can create commits with the intention of running the build pipeline using a specific branch of ADF. To achieve this, you need to add a specific CI flag in your commit message:

```text
[link-adf:my-custom-branch-in-adf-repo]
```

So for example a commit message can be like:

```text
[link-adf:my-custom-branch-in-adf-repo] Adding XYZ features for the navigation header
```

When having this CI flag present in the commit message, the CI attempts to check out the given branch of ADF and use it when building / testing the applications.

### Important things to consider

- **This flag can only be used for PRs, not for any other type of builds**
- At the end of a PR build, there is a check which will make the build fail if you used this CI flag. This is there to make sure, only those PRs can be merged, which are using already merged in ADF features, **since this flag's only purpose is to be able to test whether the applications could be built with an experimental ADF feature or not**.

    This step is rendered in the `Finalize` stage
