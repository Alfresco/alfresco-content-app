## Running

Create an `.env` file in the project root folder with the following content

```yml
BASE_URL="<URL>"
```

Where `<URL>` is the address of the ACS.

Run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Unit Tests

Use following command to test the projects:

```sh
nx test <project>
```

### Code Coverage

The projects are already configured to produce code coverage reports in console and HTML output.

You can view HTML reports in the `./coverage/<project>` folder.

When working with unit testing and code coverage improvement, you can run unit tests in the "live reload" mode:

```sh
nx test <project> -- --watch
```

Upon changing unit tests code, you can track the coverage results either in the console output, or by reloading the HTML report in the browser.
